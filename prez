env: truffle

languages:
 - solidity for contract definition
 - js for tests

truffle init: code/test examples

solidity: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/solidity-in-depth.html
 -> object oriented

contract: class

methods: calls (constant) and transactions

async: use of promises

structs

string: no "equals" -> write it or use a lib (and link it)

events

modifiers

random function

conclusion:
 tehno is young: new versions on tools are frequent -> new compiler checks, env install may work one day but not the next day, 
 with a few hours of experiments and the help of other meetup members, it is possible to create a contract that is usable on the real blockchain
 next step: graphical interface -> DAPP?
